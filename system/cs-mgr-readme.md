# Welcome to GenAI-Logic

### Governed Executable Requirements

Describe it, and get a real system:

<details markdown>
<summary>For <strong>today:</strong> a working API, Admin App, and governed logic, <strong>built from a prompt</strong></summary>

<br>Leverage AI for what it's great at — database design, data mapping, and more. Start from a prompt alone and AI designs the database too, or point it at your existing database and skip straight to the logic. Either way, your AI assistant reads whatever you already have — plain English, Gherkin, pseudocode — and hands business logic off as rules, not code.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>And it <strong>fits</strong>: uses your existing org, technology, and practices</summary>

<br>What comes out the other end is exactly what you already run:

1. **A business user can drive it, in the requirements format they already write** — plain English, Gherkin, pseudocode, even actual regulation text; no database design, screen painting, or scripting to learn.
2. **Standard IDE, standard language** — a project in the IDE and language you already use, ready to extend.
3. **Standard deploy** — a standard container; cloud or on-prem, no additional charges.
4. **Standard enterprise infrastructure** — pluggable security (SQL or Keycloak), full REST API, event/messaging integration (Kafka, webhooks) — built in, not bolted on, same as any other enterprise system.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>And for <strong>tomorrow</strong>: systems <strong><em>governed</em></strong> by rules you can <strong>Read, Trust, and Maintain</strong></summary>

<br>**The key idea:** that split — AI for executable intent, declarative rules for governance — is the whole point. Here's what "governed" means in practice:

- **Read** — [5 rules](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/logic_discovery/place_order/check_credit.py), not [~200 lines of code](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/procedural/credit_service.py). A rule you can point to and know what it does, at a glance.
- **Trust** — those rules run at **one commit point**, no matter which path the transaction came in on — API, MCP, agent, Kafka. **No bypass.**
- **Maintain** — add a rule anywhere, and the engine resolves dependency order automatically. No untangling existing code to find where it belongs.

And you're not alone throughout: ask your AI assistant anything — architecture, rules, debugging, deployment, or how the system works.

<!-- LOCAL-MGR-ONLY-START -->
Any AI assistant works here — Claude Code, the Claude Code plugin, GitHub Copilot, etc. The steps below are for **GitHub Copilot in VS Code**; if you're using something else, the same idea applies, just paste the command above into whatever chat/agent interface you have open.
<!-- LOCAL-MGR-ONLY-END -->

**Step by step:**
1. Open the **Chat** tab in the right-hand panel.
2. Click the model pill at the bottom of the chat box (shows **Auto** by default).
3. **If Claude Sonnet 5 appears in the list:** select it.
   **If it's not there:** click **Other Models** near the bottom of that same list — this expands the list to show more models, including Claude Sonnet 5. Still not there (Free/Student plans — see below): leave it on **Auto**.
4. Type the command above and press Enter.

![Choosing Claude Sonnet 5 from the model picker](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/git-codespaces/genai-logic-web-studio-choose-agent.png?raw=true)

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;Which model, and what does this cost?</summary>

<br>

**Model selection is plan-dependent** (GitHub changed this June 2026):
- **Copilot Free / Student:** Chat and Agent mode only run in **Auto** — GitHub picks the model for you from a pool that includes Claude Sonnet 4.6 among others. You cannot force Claude specifically.
- **Copilot Pro ($10/mo) and above:** Manual model selection is available — but Claude Sonnet 5 may not appear until you click **Other Models** to expand the list (see step 3 above).

**Cost, in practice:** All plans (including Free) include a monthly allotment of GitHub AI Credits for chat/agent usage — the Free plan's is small but real; Pro includes about $15/month worth. Two things keep a GenAI-Logic project cheap relative to that allotment:
- The scaffold — the API, Admin App, and database models — is generated by template, **not** by AI. The AI is only doing the design/logic work (schema decisions, rule translation, Q&A) — a small fraction of what you actually get.
- If you exceed your monthly credits, GitHub does not silently charge you — on individual plans you're prompted to either wait for the next cycle or opt in to paid overage; it does not happen by accident.

For current figures, see [GitHub Copilot plans & pricing](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans).

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;Why we recommend a frontier model</summary>

<br>

The mechanical parts of this system — folder structure, rule syntax, provenance files — come through reliably even on lighter/auto-selected models. What separates frontier models (Claude Sonnet 4.6/5, GPT-5, etc.) is judgment on subtler cases: patterns documented in the training material that require reasoning about *why* a naive implementation is wrong, not just matching a syntax example. In testing, a smaller auto-selected model built a project correctly, then wrote a real correctness bug into a follow-up rule that our own docs specifically call out as an easy mistake — and reported it as verified when it wasn't.

For exploring the product, any available model is fine. For real logic you intend to keep, pick a frontier model explicitly when your plan allows it — and review the AI's output either way, the same as you would any other engineer's.

The goal here isn't a demo — it's an **enterprise-class** system you can trust and maintain. That's exactly what gets tested next.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>AI is great — but logic-as-code is hard to Read, Trust, and Maintain — here's why</summary>

<br>AI is genuinely good at UI, data mapping, boilerplate, etc — no argument there. **Business logic is the exception.**

On a real system, business logic routinely consumes **half the development and debugging effort** — and it's the half that determines whether the system is actually correct.

Left unguided, any AI assistant — including the one that just built basic_demo for you — would default to procedural code for logic like this. Ask it directly, and you get three problems:

- **Not readable.** [procedural/credit_service.py](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/procedural/credit_service.py) — ~200 lines for those same 5 requirements. Open it and judge for yourself. Now picture a real system: 10-20X the requirements of this example, and proportionally more procedural code to match. Nobody can audit that at a glance — not the next developer, not compliance, not you in six months. At that scale, an auditor can't read it all — they can only sample, and hope. **Unreadable at scale is ungovernable at scale.**
- **Not trustworthy.** The procedural version shipped **2 real bugs** — found only by specifically testing what happens when a row is reparented to a new owner: [the A/B test](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/procedural/declarative-vs-procedural-comparison.md). Root cause: **path confusion** — procedural code must enumerate every change path (insert, update, delete, reparent) by hand, and it's easy to miss one.
- **Not maintainable.** Two options:

  - **Alter the generated code:** that means **re-checking every execution path** *and* getting the order right, by hand, again. Root causes: **path confusion** and **manual ordering** — the same problem as above, back for round two. Honestly? At some point you'd stop checking and just hope testing catches it.

  - **Change the prompt and regenerate:** doesn't dodge the risk, it repeats it — the AI is re-deriving all ~200 lines from scratch, with no guarantee it reproduces the paths that already worked. Same odds of a new bug, same review effort, again — and it only gets more expensive as the system grows.

There's a structural problem underneath the bugs, too: **AI pattern-matches dependencies, it doesn't compute them** — so the odds of a miss go up as the system grows, no matter how capable the model. [More detail →](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/procedural/declarative-vs-procedural-comparison.md#the-underlying-problem-dependency-graphs)

That's not a capability gap — it's a representation problem, and no amount of AI capability fixes that.

**We're deeply impressed with AI — this is about closing the one gap it has: logic.** That's next.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>AI-driven rules are easy to Read, Trust, and Maintain — here's how</summary>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;1. Run it — see the API and logic operate</summary>

<br>You've probably used AI to generate code before — so what's different here?

**Difference 1: it produces models, not code.** Run the basic_demo prompt above, and instead of a pile of procedural code, you get artifacts that declare structure or policy rather than procedure — same 5 requirements, same AI:

1. **Data model** — `database/models.py`
2. **Full JSON:API** — Swagger, pagination, optimistic locking (`api/expose_api_models.py` — 52 lines, zero per-table code)
3. **Admin App** — multi-table, with navigations and lookups (`ui/admin/admin.yaml` — simple YAML, not HTML/JS)
4. **Business logic** — [logic_discovery/place_order/check_credit.py](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/logic_discovery/place_order/check_credit.py) — 5 rules (~40X less), same requirements, same AI, 0 bugs

**Difference 2: the logic itself is declarative.** 5 lines, intent still clear — not ~200 lines of procedural frankencode. That's what declarative buys — more on that below.

Each small, readable, yours. Plain Python — standard tooling applies. Security is opt-in, not default — bootstrap RBAC anytime with `genai-logic add-auth`.

**See it running:** Press F5 using "API Logic Server Run (run project from manager)", and open the Admin App. Explore the API via Swagger, browse the data, and follow the relationships — all auto-generated from the data model.

Now trigger it: open an **unshipped** Order for Alice, edit the Widget item:

```
Change the quantity to a very large number. Save.
```

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;Detail Instructions -- Screen Shots</summary>

<br>Alter the quantity for an *unshipped* item:

1. Show the Customer List
2. Show the first Customer
3. Show first Order
4. Edit the Item
5. Set the quantity

![credit-check](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/credit-check.png?raw=true?raw=true)

</details>

<br>

The save fails — note the dialog. Why? Let's look.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;2. Debug it — standard logging, standard debugger</summary>

<br>No new tools required. The rule chain that just fired is in the log — plain text, readable in your terminal or editor: [sample trace](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logs/als-sample.log). A live run writes the same thing to the standard log, `logs/als.log`.

Every rule is a plain Python function or lambda. Set a breakpoint on any `calling=` function or `as_condition=` lambda in your IDE, exactly like you would anywhere else in the codebase — no proprietary debugger, no special UI.

![logic-debug](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/logic/logic-debug.png?raw=true)

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;3. Iterate — 1 AI prompt adds table, relationship, 2 rules</summary>

<br>Ask your AI assistant for a new rule, in plain English:

```
Customers should not be able to create new orders if they have unresolved past due letters.
```

There was no `Letter` table in the model — the AI adds it, relates it to `Customer`, and declares a `count` + a `constraint`. One sentence creates a schema change and two new rules — automatically integrated with the 5 already there. No need to open `check_credit.py` to find where this belongs, or trace the other rules to check for conflicts.

**A lot just happened here — worth a closer look.**

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;4. Why Rules Are Declarative — automatic calling, automatic ordering</summary>

<br>This iteration — like maintenance generally — was remarkably simple, because **rules are declarative:**

- **No need to call the new logic.** Rules are invoked automatically - regardless of the originating path.  You can **trust** that they'll always run.
- **Order doesn't matter.** Open `check_credit.py` and shuffle the five rules into any order you like. Rerun — still correct. Try that with 200 lines of procedural code.  You can **trust** that they'll run in the right order.
- **You got more than you asked for.** The original requirement said *"On Placing Orders, Check Credit"* — insert time. But the save that failed was an *edit* to an existing order. Nobody wrote an update-time check.

Functions don't behave like that. So why is that?

> **Traditional logic is procedural** — you own *how*: when it's called, and in what order. **Declarative logic — rules** — is about *what*, not how: you state the fact, and the system takes responsibility for invocation and ordering. That's why the new rule didn't need to be called, and why order didn't matter.

The next section explores this in detail. Ask your AI assistant — *"What are rules?"* — or keep reading.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details markdown>
<summary>&emsp;&emsp;5. How Declarative Rules Make Logic Easy to Read, Trust, and Maintain</summary>

<br>**Rules** enforce business policy — multi-table derivations, constraints, and actions like messaging. **LogicBank**, the rule engine, hooks SQLAlchemy's commit event to run them on every transaction — authored as plain Python functions in `logic/logic_discovery/`, readable, version-controlled, owned like any other source file.

**How it works:**
1. **At startup** — rules load, and the engine computes their dependency graph once.
2. **At commit** — for each transaction, the engine finds the rules relevant to what changed, and fires them in the right order.

Unlike procedural code, they're **declarative** — solving exactly the three problems raised above (AI great, but hard to Read, Trust, and Maintain):

| Property | What it means | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Readable** | 5 lines, one per requirement — declared once, e.g. `Customer.balance = sum of unpaid orders` | No archaeology needed to see what it does |
| **Trustworthy** | Rules fire at every commit, from every caller, on every insert *and* edit — you never call them | Can't be forgotten, can't be bypassed |
| **Maintainable** | Dependency order is computed once, automatically — not written into your source file | Add a rule anywhere, it finds its place |

> Think of a **spreadsheet:** `B10 = SUM(B1:B9)` isn't called, it *reacts* — change any input cell, it recalculates. Rules react the same way to changes in what they depend on.

Procedural code is hard to read — so you can't tell whether it's called from every caller, in the right order. That's not a testing gap; it's a representation problem.

> Declarative rules are easy to read — the intent, now rigorous — and with no bypass and automatic ordering.
>
> ***You can read the rules, and trust they are being enforced. Always.***

<details markdown>
<summary>How this works: Context Engineering (CE) + a commit-time rules engine</summary>

<br>Two things have to be true for this to work:

**Step 1 — Context Engineering trains the AI to write rules, not code.** That same AI, left unguided, would have produced the ~200 buggy lines from earlier. Writing rules instead wasn't its own idea — it was told to, in detail, by **Context Engineering** — the same files driving this conversation right now:

- **Directs rules, not code.** When you ask for business logic, CE steers the AI toward the *right* rule type (sum vs. count vs. Allocate vs. Request Pattern) for what you actually asked for, instead of letting it default to the procedural code it's seen a million times in training.

    - **Rules become the default, easy path** — not a discipline a team has to maintain by hand: familiar requirements in, rules — Read, Trust, Maintain — out.

- **Trains the AI to automate everything above, and to help you when it breaks.** EAI's 2-message Kafka pattern, the AI/Request Pattern wiring, Executable Requirements' pre-coding schema assessment — all of it is documented training material (`docs/training/*`) the AI reads *before* writing your code, not generic knowledge it's guessing from. Ask "what are rules?" or "how do rules work?" — or, without an AI handy, just read [samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/readme_logic.md](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/logic/readme_logic.md) — same material.

- **Answers your own questions, too.** Same materials, same AI — ask it directly:
    - Is this really infrastructure, like a database?
    - Is this a black box? How do I debug a rule chain?
    - Can I verify this with tests, not just take it on faith?
    - What did the AI decide on its own that I should double-check? (the ad-libs report)
    - Can I see a governance/health report for this project's logic?
    - What does it take to migrate off this if we ever wanted to?
    - How does this perform at scale?
    - What does this integrate with — APIs, workflows, agents, MCP?
    - Does this work with my existing database?

  More background: [Eval Guide](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Eval/).

  <details markdown>
  <summary>The AI was trained on this material — can you trust its answers?</summary>

  <br>Don't take them on faith. Ask the same question a different way, or ask something not covered here — like where this architecture breaks down. If it just recites the same lines back, you've caught it. If it reasons, that's the test passing.

  </details>

Put together: once the AI knows how the system works, it doesn't just generate rules instead of code — it helps you debug them, and helps you understand them. A design assistant, not just a coding assistant.

**Step 2 — the rules engine runs the rules.** Rules aren't called from your code — they're wired into a single SQLAlchemy `before_flush` listener, loaded once at server start as described above. Every write, from any path — API, custom endpoint, Kafka consumer, agent — passes through that one listener before it commits. No bypass — there's no second door.

<details markdown>
<summary>Scaling to the Enterprise — here's how</summary>

<br>With logic off its plate, AI can create remarkable results — solid enterprise systems, from requirements, not just demos that become tech debt.

**We add key *enterprise architecture* integration:**

- **Enterprise Integration (EAI)** — the demo above showed ***Publish** the Order to Kafka topic*. For the **subscribe** side, see [samples/basic_demo_eai/readme.md](samples/basic_demo_eai/readme.md): B2B orders from partner systems, via a Custom API or Kafka subscriber, including *lookups* so partners send `"Account": "Alice"` (not internal IDs).

- **MCP** — your API is **MCP-discoverable** out of the box (`/.well-known/mcp.json`).
Copilot, Claude, or ChatGPT can find the schema and answer natural-language queries against it.  There's no discovery layer for you to write — see [samples/basic_demo_ai_rules-supplier/readme_ai_mcp.md](samples/basic_demo_ai_rules-supplier/readme_ai_mcp.md)

- **AI Rules** — rules that call AI for genuinely judgment-call decisions (e.g. picking a supplier under disrupted shipping lanes).  Such AI "proposals" are governed by the deterministic rules to ensure results conform to business policy — see [samples/basic_demo_ai_rules-supplier/readme.md](samples/basic_demo_ai_rules-supplier/readme.md)

- **Custom UIs, safely** — Vibe tools (Cursor, v0, etc.) generate the UI; it's built against the same governed API, so the logic runs the same regardless of what's calling it — `genai-logic genai-add-app --vibe`.

- **Governance you can prove, not just assert** — three reports, generated from the running system, not hand-written:
    - **[Logic flow diagram](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/docs/requirements/logic_flow_basic_demo_logic_gov.md)** — NL requirement, dependency diagram, and rule summary, for every rule chain
    - **[Ad-libs report](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/docs/requirements/ad-libs.md)** — every assumption the AI made beyond the spec, so you know exactly what to verify
    - **[Health check](samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/docs/requirements/health_check.md)** — rule adoption, dependency-tracking integrity, missing docstrings, across the whole project

    A compliance reviewer can check the implementation in minutes, not by reading code.

    <img src="samples/basic_demo_logic_gov/docs/requirements/logic_diagrams/logic_diagram.svg" alt="Logic diagram: Item/Order/Customer rule chain, generated from the running rules" width="480">


That combination — AI, logic automation, and that enterprise architecture — is what enables ***Executable Requirements***: AI building real enterprise-class systems, from formats you already are familiar with, not a new syntax to learn:

- **Gherkin-style scenarios** — [business description](samples/demo_customs_clvs/readme.md), and the [actual requirements](samples/demo_customs_clvs/docs/requirements/customs_demo/requirements.md) used by AI to create the system.

- The **short prompt that built a system straight from an actual government tariff regulation** (Canada, CBSA) — [the prompt](samples/demo_customs_surtax/readme.md), and [the rules it produced](samples/demo_customs_surtax/logic/logic_discovery/cbsa_steel_surtax.py)

    > So, simply by referencing the regs, you get a complete enterprise system — including governed logic you can audit, trust, and maintain. AI implements the spec end-to-end and reports an **ad-libs list** — every decision it made beyond what the spec said — so you know exactly where it guessed.

The architecture that makes this work: two funnels, converging on one engine. All requirement formats, and all transaction sources, passing through **the same commit point. No bypass.**

**What AI delivers, once logic is off its plate: entire, *governed* systems from requirements** — not just code that becomes instant tech debt. It is this approach that **caught an 8-figure compliance exposure** a major logistics company's hand-coded system missed for months.

## Procedures

<br>

<details markdown>

<summary> Detail Procedures</summary>

<br>Specific procedures for running the demo are here, so they do not interrupt the conceptual discussion above.

You can use either VSCode or Pycharm.


**1. Establish your Virtual Environment**

Python employs a virtual environment for project-specific dependencies.

**If the project was created in this Manager** (or opened from it), the venv is already configured — just press F5.

**If the project was cloned from git**, choose one of:

* **Quickest (no VS Code setup):** from the Manager terminal (or, use Code Assistant):
    ```bash
    genai-logic run --project-name=<project-name>
    ```

* **Mac/Linux with F5:** create a symlink to the Manager venv:
    ```bash
    cd <project>
    sh venv_setup/venv.sh symlink
    # reload VS Code window, then F5
    ```

* **Any platform:** create a local venv:
    ```bash
    sh venv_setup/venv.sh go        # mac/linux
    .\venv_setup\venv.ps1 go        # windows
    ```

For PyCharm, you will get a dialog requesting to create the `venv`; say yes.

See [Project-Env](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Project-Env/) for more information.

&nbsp;

**2. Start and Stop the Server**

Both IDEs provide Run Configurations to start programs.  These are pre-built by `ApiLogicServer create`.

For VSCode, start the Server with F5, Stop with Shift-F5 or the red stop button.

For PyCharm, start the server with CTL-D, Stop with red stop button.

&nbsp;

**3. Entering a new Order**

To enter a new Order:

1. Click `Customer 1`

2. Click `+ ADD NEW ORDER`

3. Set `Notes` to "hurry", and press `SAVE AND SHOW`

4. Click `+ ADD NEW ITEM`

5. Enter Quantity 1, lookup "Product 1", and click `SAVE AND ADD ANOTHER`

6. Enter Quantity 2000, lookup "Product 2", and click `SAVE`

7. Observe the constraint error, triggered by rollups from the `Item` to the `Order` and `Customer`

8. Correct the quantity to 2, and click `Save`


**4. Update the Order**

To explore our new logic for green products:

1. Access the previous order, and `ADD NEW ITEM`

2. Enter quantity 11, lookup product `Green`, and click `Save`.

### Pre-created Samples

<details markdown>

<summary> Explore Pre-created Samples</summary>

<br>The `samples` folder has pre-created important projects you will want to review at some point (Important: look for **readme files**):

* [nw_sample_nocust](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/) - northwind (customers, orders...) database

    * This reflects the results you can expect with your own databases

* [nw_sample](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Database/) - same database, but with ***with [customizations](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/IDE-Customize/) added***.  It's a great resource for exploring how to customize your projects.

    * Hint: use your IDE to search for `#als`

* [tutorial](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/) - short (~30 min) walk-through of using API Logic Server using the northwind (customers, orders...) database

</br>

<details markdown>

<summary>You can always re-create the samples</summary>

<br>Re-create them as follows:

1. Open a terminal window (**Terminal > New Terminal**), and paste the following CLI command:

```bash
ApiLogicServer create --project-name=samples/tutorial --db-url=
ApiLogicServer create --project-name=samples/nw_sample --db-url=nw+
ApiLogicServer create --project-name=samples/nw_sample_nocust --db-url=nw
```
</details>

### Hiding Front Matter

<details markdown>

<summary>Hiding Front Matter </summary>

To hide the YAML or JSON front matter (the metadata block at the top of your markdown files) in the built-in VS Code markdown preview, you can adjust your editor settings:

1. Open the Settings panel using Ctrl + , (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + , (macOS).
2. Search for the following term: `markdown.previewFrontMatter`.
3. Change the dropdown value from show to `hide`.

The preview will now automatically strip the front matter from the rendered view.
